# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to expand on the UFO Sightings webpage that was already built during the JavaScript Module. The updates to the webpage allow for filtering on multiple criteria at the same time.  By modifying code in the index.html file, additional filter fields of City, State, Country, and Shape were added.

## Results: 
The UFO Sightings webpage was successfully updated to include an expanded filter section with five options to filter, as indicated in the image below:

Shown in the image below is a close-up of the five filters that were created. The required format of each field is indicated through showing a "greyed out" example of the format requirement.

The filter options allow the webpage participant to enter criteria on one field or more.  Captured below is an image of one field selected, which is the Date field with a criteria entered of 01/08/2010.

In the image below, multiple multiple fields have been selected to further narrow the search criteria. The criteria selected were State = Florida (fl) and Shape = "sphere."

The webpage participant can clear a search by either deleting the enteries in the fields or by clicking on the "UFO Sightings" banner at the top of the page.

## Summary: 
### Drawbacks
Although the webpage turned out beautifully, there are some drawbacks to the page. One major drawback is the constraints or limitations inherent to the current filter table fields because they require exact formatting and knowledge of the selection in order to return a result.  In addition, the webpage does not indicate a date range for the included data. 

### Recommendations
1. To improve search capabilities, I would recommend several updates to include: creating drop downs in each searchfield search to allow for an interactive experience where selections are available and obvious to the participant; allowing the actual data table to be sorted ascending/descending and filtered; allowing for multiple entry selections and ranges; and allowing for exporting of data.
2. For a more robust experience, I would recommend the inclusion of images tied to the data, along with the ability for the user to export data.
