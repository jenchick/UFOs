# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
The purpose is well-defined.
webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria; modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape

## Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.  
There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.

Clear filter search by either deleting the enteries in the Filter fields or by clicking on the "UFO Sightings" banner at the top of the page.


## Summary: 
The summary addresses/describes one drawback of this webpage
Major drawback is the limitation of the Filter Search entry boxes.  What date range is this data?

The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
1. allow for drop downs in each field search, allow for interactive table that can be sorted ascending/descending and filtered. Allow for multiple entry selection, ranges.  Allow for exporting of data.
2. images
