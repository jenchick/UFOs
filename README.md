# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to expand on the UFO Sightings webpage that was already built during the JavaScript Module. The updates to the webpage allow for filtering on multiple criteria at the same time.  By modifying code in the index.html file, additional filter fields of City, State, Country, and Shape were added.

## Results: 
The UFO Sightings webpage was successfully updated to include an expanded filter section with five options to filter, as indicated in the image below:

Filtered on one field, for example, Date, only: 01/08/2010

Filtered on multiple fields, for example, State = Florida (fl) and Shape = "sphere"

Clear filter search by either deleting the enteries in the Filter fields or by clicking on the "UFO Sightings" banner at the top of the page.


## Summary: 
The summary addresses/describes one drawback of this webpage
Major drawback is the limitation of the Filter Search entry boxes.  What date range is this data?  Reference in quote to "Citizen-scientist can be especially helpful in...cataloguing sitings..." with no indication of how to do so/how to participate.

The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
1. allow for drop downs in each field search, allow for interactive table that can be sorted ascending/descending and filtered. Allow for multiple entry selection, ranges.  Allow for exporting of data.
2. Allow for uploading of images!!!!
